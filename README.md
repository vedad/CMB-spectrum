##	Calculating the CMB power spectrum
Repository for the project in AST5220 - Cosmology II at the University of Oslo, spring 2015.

We will in this project make a code for calculating the CMB power spectrum for the Standard Model of
Cosmology (LCDM). We will do this through four milestones. 
***
#### ~~Milestone I: The background evolution of the universe~~
Here we calculate some of the background cosmology, such as the evolutions of the Hubble parameter,
the horizon and the density parameters for the LCDM universe.
***
#### Milestone II: The recombination history of the universe
***
#### Milestone III: The evolution of structures in the universe
***
#### Milestone IV: The CMB power spectrum
***

To see the newest version at any time, check the `dev-mac` branch. All changes will be merged to
`master` at the end of each milestone.
