##	Calculating the CMB power spectrum
Repository for the project in AST5220 - Cosmology II at the University of Oslo, spring 2015.

We will in this project make a code for calculating the CMB power spectrum for the Standard Model of
Cosmology (LCDM). We will do this through four milestones. 
***
#### Milestone I: The background evolution of the universe
###### Completed
Here we calculate some of the background cosmology, such as the evolutions of the Hubble parameter,
the horizon and the density parameters for the LCDM universe.
***
#### Milestone II: The recombination history of the universe
###### Completed
Here we calculate more of the background cosmology; focusing on the
recombination history of the universe. We calculate the free electron fraction,
the optical depth and visibility function as functions of time.
***
#### Milestone III: The evolution of structures in the universe
###### Completed
Here we solve the linearized Einstein and Boltzmann equations for photons,
baryons and dark matter in order to compute the evolution of structures in our
universe.
***
#### Milestone IV: The CMB power spectrum
###### Completed
Here we pull everything from the previous milestones together to calculate the
CMB power spectrum, and vary cosmological parameters to find the best fit to
Planck 2015 data.

Description of the different milestones will be updated continuously.

To see the newest version of the code at any time, check the `dev-mac` branch:
* `pycode` contains Python code for the milestones, including plotting.
* ~~`src` contains Fortran 90 code that will be used throughout the rest of the milestones.~~
Used Python throughout.
